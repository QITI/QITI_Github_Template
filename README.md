# QITI_Github_Template
Use this repository as a reference.  Follow the guidelines described here in the read-me, and organize your files well.

1) If you are creating a new repository, make sure that it is referenced in a relevant wiki-page.  Use the wiki page to describe the broad features of the files in the repository.
2) If your repository contains code, briefly state any dependencies, installations, or other prerequisites to run the code.  If multiple files contain code, briefly describe their roles, heirarchies, or dependencies to each other.
3) If your repository contains CAD, make sure that the README includes a description of the parts or assemblies (not just part numbers), and that components are sorted into folders if many components are used.
